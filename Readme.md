# Refactored Deep Learning Ideas

+ examples: standard examples including the spiral dataset and mnist
+ flow/dsl: setup of the neural computation graph
+ flow/computation: all possible computations:
  - add
  - mul
  - relu
  - softmax
+ flow/optimization: sgd and adam
+ putting all together in neural net class
